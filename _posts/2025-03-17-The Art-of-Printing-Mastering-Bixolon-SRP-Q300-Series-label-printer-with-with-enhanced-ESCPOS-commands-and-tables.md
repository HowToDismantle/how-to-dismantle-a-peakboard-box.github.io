A couple of weeks ago we already introduced the topic about [how to print with Peakboard](/The-Art-of-Printing-Getting-started-with-label-printing-on-Seiko-SLP720RT.html). We learned how to use the POS printer extension and how to use the simplified, internal commands to build ESC/POS command set to be sent to the printer. In today's article we will deepen some new aspects of printing:

1. How to use the Bixolon SRP-Q300 printer
2. How to use pure ESC/POS command in case a command is not covered by the simplified command set
3. How to print tables
